<p id="description">I've built a cool website that's actually a clone of a popular one called "Abstract." I took the help center page from the original site and recreated it as a project which I found on a website called Frontend Practice. I put a lot of effort into making it look and work just like the original so when you visit my version you'll get the same helpful and user-friendly experience. It's a fun project that I'm proud of!</p>

<p> You can access the clone I built using the following link <a href="https://help.abstract.com/hc/en-us#h5o-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here </a></P>
